                You may be led to therapy by anxiety, depression, relationship stress,
                past or recent trauma, grief and loss, self-esteem issues, or challenges
                with family, parenting, or parental relationships. Whatever the source of
                your stress, you don&apos;t have to face it alone. Therapy offers you the time
                and space to work toward wellness and peace.
